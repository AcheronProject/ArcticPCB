See [this page](https://gondolindrim.github.io/AcheronDocs/arctic/intro.html) for the ArcticPCB documentation.

## Introduction

Arctic is an STM32F072-based universal 60% keyboard PCB featuring limited layouts and features. The layouts were cherry-picked by enthusiast ArcticFox and consist of only Tsangan bottom row. 

This PCB also features "relief" flex cuts aimed at improving keyboard typing feeling.

Arctic hold a very special place in my heart as it was one of the first two PCBs, together with the KeebsPCB, in the Acheron Project and effectively inaugurated it.

## Contributors

- Raphael "ArcticFox" Hochheim for helping choosing the compatible layouts
- Felipe 'MrKeebs" Coury who paid for the V1 prototypes and helped immensely by funding my learning
- PCBWay for sponsoring the pre-revision Alpha prototypes

## PCBWay sponsorship

The pre-revision Alpha of the ArcticPCB was sponsored by [PCBWay](http://www.pcbway.com), a big asian PCB manufacturer that provided prototypes for the Arctic.
